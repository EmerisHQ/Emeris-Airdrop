    "projectDescription": "Quicksilver is a permissionless, sovereign Cosmos SDK zone providing liquid staking for the entire Cosmos Ecosystem. Users are issued a voucher, qASSET, representative of their native bonded asset upon delegation, which can then be used in DeFi protocols. Quicksilver can scale seamlessly to any IBC-connected chain, and users participating in the protocol will be able to stake with any validator of their choosing (no whitelisted validator set), as well as retain their voting rights through a governance by proxy model.",
