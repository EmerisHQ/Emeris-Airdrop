    "projectDescription": "Marble Dao is among the first Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) on Juno Network. They are building the future of Decentralized Finance and their aim is to create a community-driven project where people can vote, stake, earn, lend and trade NFTs safely. Juno is getting bigger and bigger. This is just the beginning and they are part of its improvement. They are going to create several decentralized applications (dApps) with multi-chain smart contracts, the most remarkable feature on Cosmos: the Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC). They will be able to use a wide range of features like the smart contracts on Juno and the privacy-based characteristics of Secret Network. They want to create a DeFi ecosystem with privacy features.",
